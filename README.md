# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project README.md 

Contains R code, CodeBook.md, and the two sets of tidy data (merged_tidy_data.txt, and Summarized_tidy_data.txt)

## Files in this repo:

**README.md**

**run.analysis.R** contains code to download and clean data to generate tidy data. Code performs these activities:

1.  Merge training and test sets to create one data set
2.  Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3.  Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately label the data set with variable names
5.  From the data set in step 4, create a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

**merged_tidy_data.txt** contains data that results from steps 1-4 above.

**Summarized_tidy_data.txt** contains data that resulted from step 5 above (average of each variable for each activity and each subject).

**CodeBook.md** contains descriptions of data, variables, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
